# Sunscope-AOHRSI-Course-

A repository for detecting solar panels on rooftops on high resolution imagery in R and QGIS.

## Motivation
In view of climate change, phasing out conventional energy sources is one of the most important issues of our time. Germany's climate targets are clearly formulated: greenhouse gas emissions are to be reduced by at least 65% by 2030, by at least 88% by 2040 and net greenhouse gas neutrality is to be achieved by 2045. One effective way for private households to do their bit is to install solar panels on the roofs of their homes. We want to investigate the extent to which this option is already being utilised and how much potential there is for improvement.

To do this, we want to use deep learning to automatically detect solar panels on satellite imagesdeep learning to automatically detect solar panels on satellite images.

## Goal
* Detecting solar panels on rooftops
* In an easy way:
  * Minimal human resources
  * Small amount of training data
  * Estimating the missed potential concerning the nationwide coverage in solarpanels
* In future -> Finding potential rooftops for solar panels

## Workflow
